        So where the fuck do I start!
      </p>
      <p>
      	Note: I actually didn't know where to start. Going through and seeing my wish I'm not happy with it, but it has everything I want to say. I should have structured it way better, but I'm legit trying my best and re-reading it and I have no idea how to. I'm really sorry for not being able to express how I feel cause I'm usually good at this. Ok note is over, now deal with reading this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The video and the code you made for my birthday man, dudddddddeeeeeeee that's the sweetest thing anyone has done for me <b>NO CAP!!!!!!!!</b> Like seeing you put that much effort for me, when I clearly didn't deserve it just made me feel super loved. Like don't get me wrong, you have done the sweetest things for me, but like the video was some next level shit and I felt so happy to know that there's a guy that still loves me so fucking much despite all my imperfections.
      </p>
      <p>
        So hence, I made it my goal, to make sure I give you back what you deserve, to give back you have been giving me from the day I met you, to make you feel as happy and excited like a small kid opening christmas gifts as I was that day going through code and watching the video. You have given so much to so many people and I just thought of giving you a smol % of that back to show you how much you have given everybody. So yes, I legit started thinking of what I would do for your birthday after the amazing convo we had on my birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
        So like, you know that my insecurities won't let me make a video, so hence I decided to do something that I'm good at will make you happy too, that's right <s>I made a porno</s> <span class="haha sike you thought">I made an HTML document</span>. It's very ironical that I say I'm coding you a wish because I'm good at it, but me coding a wish is basically me texting a wish, and <em>BOI IS MY TEXTING GAME WACK</em>, ahem but yes we move.

        Shivam, shivam, shivam. You are a fucking gem man. The number of ways you have helped me is just so much. I have many flaws and not to flex on you but I'm pretty good at hiding them, but man, with you I can just be myself and the reason why is because you would happily accept me the way I am. And not only that, it's not that I can be myself, but instead you make me want to be myself, because you have such a welcoming mindset that no one needs to pretend to be someone else around you cause you're going to love them anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        And dude, you're legit one of the funniest people I have met dude. Like I'm pretty sure the reason I have abs is because of those calls we used to have and we both just used to keep adding on and making jokes and making each other laugh till our abs hurts. 11th and 12th was fun because a huge part of the classes were listening to your jokes (I mean let's be real, I wasn't listening shit from the teachers).
      </p>
      <p>
        You are the best person to be with whenever I feel down. See, like I know I don't vent to you most of the time, but just being with you is the best thing to do, cause it's super comforting to be with someone who's just super cheerful and who loves you so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        See you deserve the best and I know I am not the best and that I don't deserve you but I need you a lot cause you have helped me so much and hence even though I can't give you everything you want, I'll make sure I try my best.
      </p>
      <p>
      	You're a strong dude man, a really strong dude, you've gone through fuck all and you're still fighting man and I'm really sorry I haven't been able to help these days with what you're going through. I heavily admire you making depressing jokes when you're going through shit, I mean don't get me wrong, I hate it when you do that cause I don't like you going through shit and not talking to me about it, but the fact that you're first instinct is to pretend to be happy for others shows a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Man all the fucking memories with you, I don't think I can have that with anyone else because you're just <em>built different</em>. I'm just super grateful that you are like this, because thinking about this wish just made me realise how much I needed you. So I just hope you don't change and that 18 year old Shivam isn't rude to me :(
      </p>
      <p>
      	It's super weird to think that I only started talking to you since 11th, because the amount of times I have been with you and the times we have been together just makes me think you're one of my childhood friends. Like just think about it, I have been friends with aradhan for a long time, but only after meeting you did I start going outside and talking to people out of school. I swear, it's kinda scary thinking about how 11th and 12th would have been if it weren't for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shivam, I honestly wish the best for you dude. I know these months haven't been the best but I just hope you realise how much of a blessing you are to mine and many people's lives. Hope you have a happy life and that I'm with you till the end of it :3. So yes, Happy birthday and hope you have a great year, macha. I love you â™¥
