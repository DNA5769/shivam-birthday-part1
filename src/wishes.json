I'm very grateful for this part of your life that you have shared with me. I cherish all that we have shared together (sexy times). the meetups and walks, the 3 hour long deep conversations that lead from nowhere to nowhere (but its the journey that matters right?), The VC talks, building on each other's jokes on the bois group, the sexting ofc(this may come as a shock to you but ducky sungirl is actually me)😳😉. we've learnt and unlearned together, grown and fell together. thinking about all this makes me very emotional. I wouldn't give away our friendship for the world(T&C apply😳💸). as a group we may be fuckin professionals in writing paragraphs but we probably don't aknowledge all the shit that you go through to stick with us as much as we should. but yeah. gucciswagosaurus.  and yes also i know you will do epic well in life. fuck it man you can see the quality of my sentences drOp. gotta save some shit for the call also. that's all bro. thats all the attention you be getting ryt now. k bye. sexy vegan. sexy time.",
